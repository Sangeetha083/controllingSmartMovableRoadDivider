Requirements
IR Sensors: Detect the presence and count of vehicles on either side of the divider.
Ultrasonic Sensors: Measure the distance to the nearest vehicle, aiding in precise traffic density measurement.
DC Motors: Enable movement of the road divider.
H-Bridge Circuit: Control the direction and speed of the DC motors.
Arduino Uno: Serve as the central control unit, processing sensor data and executing control algorithms.
LCD Display: Provide a user interface for displaying system status and traffic information.
Reset Button: Allow manual resetting of the system.
